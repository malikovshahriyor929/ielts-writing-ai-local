I disagree with this opinion and I think that computer technology has given a lot of benefits to our communications, medicine and transport system , instead of creating dangerous situations , but I also think someone would be against this development.

First of all, I believe that thanks the development of technologies we have achieve a lot of new facilities such as the smartphone, a device which can interlink anyone through the internet , for instance you can talk to someone in the opposite side of the world in a few seconds.  Computers have also revolutionized the world of medicine, for example , sometimes can give a more accurate information about someone’s disease than a doctor knowledge. Nowadays ,the computer technology is being essential,  thanks an introduction of artificial intelligence in medical machines , doctors can foresee a bad disease such as cancer thanks to these facilities.

With the artificial intelligence trend even the transport system can benefit from it, for instance , in US , uber has introduced self-driving taxi cars , which can be booked from an app on the smartphone and a car without a driver will come to you and will bring you wherever.

In my opinion the improvement of technologies has brought a new lifestyle in everyone , but someone says that could create dangerous situations such as more and more workers fired from their jobs because a computer has replaced their work.

In conclusion , I think new technologies have a relevant place in our society and can give a hand  to each sector of our lifestyle.
